# task-manager-flask-app

This is a simple web app in dev mode that allows to interact with a sqlite database *adding*, *deleting*, and *updating* tasks.

As I use PowerShell, I created a `run.ps1` script that runs the app on the server. If you are also on Windows, the environment variable syntax depends on command line interpreter. Check out [Flask documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/) for more details.
